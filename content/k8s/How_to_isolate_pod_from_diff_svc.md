title: "How to isolate pods of different services"

### Objective:
1. Pods from different service deployments should never run on the same node.
2. Pods of the same deployment should stay on the same node preferably.
3. The above should work after node autoscaling happens.

### Pathfinding:
- Req #1 repels pods from the node running ones of a different service --> hard podAntiAffinity
- Req #2 collects pods under the same service and runs them on the same node at the best --> soft podAffinity  
  We should then use requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution for AntiAffinity and preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution for Affinity
- AntiAffinity codes should look like below, so that a pod will NOT run on a node where pods with a different service label are running:
```yaml
requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
- labelSelector:
    matchExpressions:
    - key: <pod service label>
      operator: NotIn
      values:
      - <labelValue>
  topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
```
- Affinity codes should look like below:
```yaml
preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
- weight: 100
  podAffinityTerm:
    labelSelector:
      matchExpressions:
      - key: component
        operator: In
        values:
        - historical
    topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
```
All good as it seems so far? Almost but here is the trick: will a pod still get scheduled after the autoscaler spawns a new node?  
The test proves to be negative. And the autoscaler even refuses to do that because it does not think a new node will help. And that’s TRUE!  
**The Fix**  
Back to the hard AntiAffinity part, does it match a new node where nothing is running?  
It does, because no pod service label exists in any pods running on that node. As a result, a new pod will never get scheduled on any new nodes created by the cluster autoscaler.  
Let’s add one more constraint to AntiAffinity and make it look like this, which will effectively free a new node and make it schedulable:  
```yaml
requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
- labelSelector:
    matchExpressions:
    - key: <pod service label>
      operator: Exists
    - key: <pod service label>
      operator: NotIn
      values:
      - <labelValue>
  topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
```
The test passed!
- When a new service is deployed, the autoscaler will spawn a new AKS node to accomodate it.
- When any existing services ask for more pods which exceed the current node capacity, a new node will also be created where those extra pods will be running.
